<h3>Objective Statement</h3>

<h3>Experience</h3>
<h3>2020</h3>
<h4>Warehousing, MDI Australia</h4>
<p>
    I volunteered to help this company with the relocating of their location and stock. I was tasked with restocking the shelves with boxes and assorting them to the correct location. I worked for 8-10 hours each day and learned how to focus and be organized for long periods of time.
</p>

<h3>2021</h3>
<h4>Volunteering, Meals on Wheels Inala</h4>
<p>I volunteered to help this non-profit organization by aiding in the kitchen with preparing meals and cleansing dishes/disinfecting food and areas. I also provided assistance with delivering food to people in need and got to experience communicating and supporting people from less privileged backgrounds. This experience was very valuable to me.</p>


<h3>2021</h3>
<h4>Tutoring, Kumon</h4>
<p>I was hired part-time to tutor kids ranging from Grade 1-6. I learned how to communicate well with children and got along well with some of the students. I tutored for the majority of each semester and even filled in for some classes this year.</p>
